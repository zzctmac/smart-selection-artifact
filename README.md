2. A Java project ([78_caloriecount](./78_caloriecount)) used to show how to use the binary file.
3. [benchmark_classes.csv](./benchmark_classes.csv) shows the experimental subjects used in RQ1-7.
4. [sample_bugs.csv](./sample_bugs.csv) shows the experimental subjects used in RQ8.
5. The experimental data ([experimental_data](./experimental_data)) and the corresponding Python script ([scripts](./scripts)) to analyze and transform the experimental data to the result data used in tables and figures of the paper.

The introduction to use the artifact is in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).
